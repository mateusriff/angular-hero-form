# Template-driven Hero Form

This project was made following Angular's [template-driven form tutorial](https://angular.io/guide/forms#building-a-template-driven-form). It's a simple application form for a fictional hiring agency for heroes.

It uses two-way binding with `ngModel`, template reference variables and Twitter's Bootstrap. It also provides visual feedback using special CSS classes that track the state of the controls, displays validation errors to users and conditionally allows input from form controls based on the form status.
